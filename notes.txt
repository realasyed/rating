Turns out data preprocessing is a pretty big deal and takes a while to learn. Progress will likely be slow for now.
I've found a tutorial series on YouTube so that should help.

What are my dependent and independent variables?:
Since my model is supposed to predict ratings, `IMBD_Ratings` is the dependent variable; it depends on other factors like
`Genre` and `Director`. However, things like `Gross` might be dependent on `IMBD_Ratings` so I have a couple dependent
variables to deal with.
